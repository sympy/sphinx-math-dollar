def split_dollars(text):
    r"""
    Split text into text and math segments.

    Returns a list of tuples ``(type, text)``, where ``type`` is either
    ``"text"``, ``"math"``, or ``"display math"``, and ``text`` is the text.

    Example:

    >>> split_dollars(r"The functions $\sin(x)$ and $$\cos(x)$$.")
    [('text', 'The functions '), ('math', '\\sin(x)'), ('text', ' and '),
    ('display math', '\\cos(x)'), ('text', '.')]

    More precisely, do a regular expression search.  To match as math, the
    first character after the first $ should not be a space. This is to avoid
    false positives with things like

    $ cd ~
    $ ls

    Escaped dollars (\$) are also not matched as math delimiters, however all
    escaped dollars are replaced with normal dollars in the final output.

    Math is allowed to be split across multiple lines, as it's assumed the
    dollars will appear in places like docstrings where line wrapping is
    desired.

    This also doesn't replace dollar signs enclosed in curly braces,
    to avoid nested math environments, such as ::

      $f(n) = 0 \text{ if $n$ is prime}$

    Thus the above line would get matched fully as math.

    # This searches for "$blah$" inside a pair of curly braces --
    # don't change these, since they're probably coming from a nested
    # math environment.  So for each match, we replace it with a temporary
